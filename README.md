1. Identify what aspects of the work have been correctly implemented and what have not.

	The site functions properly, but is very simple (and ugly) needs a lot of work to become a real resume.

2. Identify anyone with whom you have collaborated or discussed the lab.

	Collaborated and discussed the lab with no other people.  Did use ChatGPT to generate a fake Bio and Resume for FERPA reasons.  The image is an illustration I made years ago.

3. Say approximately how many hours you have spent completing the lab.

	About 3 hours.
