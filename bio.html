        From an early age, Taylor was curious and had a strong desire to learn, devouring books on a wide range of topics. They were an excellent student and excelled in their studies, particularly in science and technology. However, despite their academic success, Taylor found themselves increasingly drawn to the world of art, and in their spare time, they would experiment with different mediums, from painting to digital art.

There, they were exposed to a world of creativity and experimentation, and their skills quickly developed.
